Conversation: Developing a 1024-bit Bus 68000 CPU SBC
Date: September 26, 2025

Human: I want to develop a cpu that has 1024 bit bus. The cpu would be based on a Motorola 68000 architecture

Assistant: Developing a CPU based on the Motorola 68000 (m68k) architecture with a 1024-bit external data bus is an ambitious and intriguing project! The m68k is a classic 16/32-bit CISC design from 1979, known for its elegant instruction set and use in systems like the Amiga, Atari ST, and early Macs. It features eight 32-bit data registers (D0–D7), eight 32-bit address registers (A0–A7, with A7 as the stack pointer), and a 16-bit status register. Addressing modes are rich and flexible, including direct register, indirect with offsets/indexing, PC-relative, absolute, and immediate—supporting byte, word (16-bit), and long (32-bit) operations. Originally, it had a 16-bit external data bus and 24-bit address bus (16 MB space), but internally everything was 32-bit for future-proofing. Later family members like the 68020 bumped the external bus to 32 bits.

Widening the external data bus to 1024 bits (128 bytes per transfer) would dramatically boost memory bandwidth—potentially transferring 1 KB in just 4 cycles at DDR speeds around 500 MHz—but it's not straightforward. Key challenges include:
- Pin count explosion: A 1024-bit data bus alone requires 1024 I/O pins, plus address lines (e.g., 32-bit for 4 GB space), controls, clocks, and power—easily 2,000+ pins total, making ASIC fabrication expensive and complex.
- Routing and signal integrity: Wider buses increase capacitance, crosstalk, and power draw, often forcing lower clock speeds to maintain reliability. Short transactions (e.g., single bytes) could suffer from underutilization or aliasing in multi-bus designs.
- Memory subsystem: You'd need ultra-wide RAM (e.g., custom DDR or FPGA block RAM arrays), which isn't off-the-shelf. Power efficiency drops, and heat becomes an issue.
- Architecture fit: The m68k's internal 32-bit datapath means the wide bus shines for bulk transfers (e.g., vector ops or crypto), but you'd need extensions like wider registers or SIMD instructions to fully leverage it—otherwise, it's mostly I/O-bound.

This setup could suit niche apps like high-throughput data processing or retro computing accelerators, but for general-purpose, it's overkill compared to modern 256–512-bit buses in GPUs.

### Recommended Approach: Prototype on FPGA
Start with an FPGA for simulation and testing—it's cost-effective and lets you iterate without fab costs. Tools like Xilinx Vivado (free WebPACK) or Intel Quartus handle Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL. Use an affordable board like the Digilent Nexys A7 (~$200) or something with more pins/I/O for the wide bus.

#### Step 1: Base It on an Open-Source m68k Core
Fork an existing implementation and modify the bus interface. Two strong options:

- FX68K (SystemVerilog): A cycle-accurate 68000 core that's functionally identical to the original in timing and behavior (e.g., bus signals). It fits in ~5,100 logic elements (LEs) on Altera Cyclone FPGAs, runs up to ~40 MHz effective clock, and uses ~5 KB internal RAM. The bus interface mimics the original 16-bit synchronous design—easy to widen by parameterizing data width in the I/O module (e.g., change data_out[15:0] to [1023:0]).

- TG68K (VHDL): A resource-efficient core switchable between 68000/68010/68020 modes, optimized for retro projects like Amiga/Atari clones. It prioritizes speed over cycle-exactness, using fewer FPGA resources for faster execution. Bus interface is modular for customization (e.g., adapt the memory controller for wider ports).

I'd lean toward FX68K for precision, but TG68K if FPGA space is tight.

#### Step 2: Modify for 1024-Bit Bus
- Datapath tweaks: In the core's top-level module, expand the external data ports to 1024 bits. Update multiplexers and alignment logic for big-endian handling (m68k standard). Internally, keep 32-bit ALU/registers but add buffering for wide loads/stores.
- Memory controller: Design a custom one to handle 1024-bit bursts. Use FPGA primitives like BRAM or external DDR4 (e.g., via MIG IP core in Vivado). For simulation, start with a simple wide RAM model in Verilog.
- Address bus: Keep 32-bit for 4 GB space (extending the original 24-bit), adding byte enables for partial writes.
- Controls: Add strobes for bus sizing (m68k supports dynamic 8/16/32-bit peripherals via UDS/LDS pins—extend to 1024-bit granularity).
